      <description>Audio Visualizers I&amp;rsquo;ve uploaded lots of stuff to YouTube, so I&amp;rsquo;ll just embed a few of them which I think you might find mildly interesting. Most of them are just visualizers for some of my songs. I&amp;rsquo;m not in the game of making music videos, but I figured it&amp;rsquo;d be nice to look at something more&amp;hellip; &amp;ldquo;alive&amp;rdquo; than a still photo or album art.
   
I was able to hack together a Blender script to generate some moving bars automated/controlled by the volume of the audio at a given frequency.</description>

      <description>Close your eyes, sit back, and feel the stillness sweep over you. Quiet synths introduce you to a calm and peaceful realm where the world seems right and clear. Then soft guitars take you airborne and show a view of the world from overhead as the sun sets in the distance. This is Dusk.
I am very excited to share with you my new song which I‚Äôm calling ‚ÄúDusk.‚Äù I had shared a WIP with you all on Soundcloud for a while under the working title of ‚ÄúMorning Coffee.</description>

      <description>Time has a very unique sound. It&amp;rsquo;s probably best described as an electronic / steam-punk track.
Time starts out very soft and innocent, with sounds of industry (trains and machine squeaks) in the background. The chorus gets hard and heavy, grinding out the melody. The second and third choruses, the lead comes in, releasing rich melodies to complete the whole theme.
You can listen to &amp;ldquo;Time&amp;rdquo; on some common platforms linked below, or you may choose to buy the track, name your price (i.</description>

      <description>I released my song ‚ÄúParticulate‚Äù a couple days ago. I started out by just posting a screen-recording video of the song on YouTube and then later posted it on SoundCloud.
A couple days after the SC posting, I found out that the CEDM (or Christian Electronic Dance Music) network re-posted my song to their Soundcloud profile, which was super cool! I feel pretty honored to have gotten that recognition.</description>

      <description>This is a brand new song I wrote rather quickly. I haven‚Äôt written an original song in a long while. I‚Äôve been doing remixes and whatnot. I had a lot of fun making this and got really passionate about it.
In this song, I kind of went back to my deeper, serious, and more thoughtful side. It‚Äôs quieter. It‚Äôs got a nice, deep cello and some rich synths pulsating through. I also recorded a little vocal line for the chorus that adds a little more of a human element to it.</description>

      <title>NEWS!! ‚Äì Spade‚Äôs in a Remix Contest</title>

      <description>So, I just wanted to give a shout out to a musical bro of mine. He just submitted his remix entry to the Citizen‚Äôs ‚ÄúMade Alive‚Äù remix contest. I was chatting with Spade and he was saying how excited he was to enter into this contest and I think that excitement really shows in the product that came out.
You gotta listen to his remix of Citizen‚Äôs song ‚ÄúMade Alive‚Äù! üòÄ</description>

      <description>Well. I worked for a long while on this. Finally decided to just throw it out there. Listening to it now, I can hear a couple things that I meant to change but didn‚Äôt.
Anywho. Hopefully you enjoy my remix of Spade&amp;rsquo;s (Adrian Cardwell&amp;rsquo;s) song ‚ÄúReach For The Sky.‚Äù You can download it for free on SoundCloud.

      <title>Behind the Name</title>

      <description>I‚Äôd like to explain where the name ‚ÄúRed Ambassador‚Äù came from. There is a meaning behind it, actually.
Before I called myself ‚ÄúRed Ambassador‚Äù, I went by the artist name ‚ÄúRED 7‚Äù (in all caps). That was just a name I had used as an internet name for a while. It was kind of something that stemmed from the fact that I liked the color red and I also liked WWII air force terminology.</description>
