Congratulations to all of our winners! Thank you for participating in this 
year’s competition. It’s exciting to see all these LMMS artists coming
together.

This year, we made ACTUAL AWARDS for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place winners! Yes, 
they’re paper/pdf awards, but better than nothing, eh? Maybe you can print
them off and put them on your wall or take a picture of you holding your
award and post it to my Facebook page. :-)

Meanwhile, take a look at entries who made it to the top-10 list! Congrats
to you all! Hopefully we can do this again next year!
