Time has a very unique sound. It's probably best described as an electronic /
steam-punk track.

Time starts out very soft and innocent, with sounds of industry (trains and
machine squeaks) in the background. The chorus gets hard and heavy, grinding
out the melody. The second and third choruses, the lead comes in, releasing
rich melodies to complete the whole theme.

You can listen to "Time" on some common platforms linked below, or you may
choose to buy the track, **name your price** *(i.e. free, if you think it's a
crap song)* on Bandcamp.

<!--If you want more specific links to the samples or tools that I used, you’re not
going to get them, for a couple reasons. One is that I don’t want my website to
end up with a ton of dead links if samples start dropping off of these websites.
Another reason is that it took me a long time to find all these samples and I
believe hard work is what makes music better. You really have to put effort
into music and I want to avoid having someone come along and try to just re-make
something that I spent a lot of time to build. None the less, here are some
pointers to things I used to create this song. Please don’t abuse this list.-->

> Notes from a soft, melodic music box fills the air. It’s almost soothing.

> mercilessly at our face. Thrust into a Wonderland where gears move
> everything, steam powers all machines, and magic happens, you are on a
> peculiar journey of music. Explore these curiosities, but don’t take too
