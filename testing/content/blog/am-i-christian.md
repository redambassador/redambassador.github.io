Sometimes I think people might wonder if I’m really a Christian artist. Like,
after all, I haven’t really made many songs with something related to Christ
in the title. I don’t sing in my songs, hardly ever, so you don’t hear 
worship lyrics… Is this guy really who he says he is?

Short answer: Yes, I am a Christian musician/producer. I think we’ve just got
two different views on what “Christian music” is all about. Allow me to
explain.

I just released my steampunk song “Time” and electronic/steampunk is not 
traditionally known for “Christian” attributes. I’ve also done a lot of covers
and remixes of songs that really don’t talk about Christ or are even related
to Christian ideas. However, I do believe that this honors God. Why? God
created music. God also created me to have a love for music. He did not give
me a great voice (not saying this as a complaint, just as a fact) so I make
instrumental music a lot. I have so much fun coming up with a new music idea
and experimenting with it until I come up with an entire new song. I enjoy the
(current) challenge of making the best music I can with free software. It’s
fun and I truly enjoy it.

I choose not to compose or associate myself with songs that use explicit
language or promote sinful activities. Outside of those things, I feel that I
have the freedom to make anything that might come to mind. I don’t see
anything wrong with writing a song based around a fantasy idea of what the
world would have looked like if steam technology was promoted more than it was.
I have boundaries, yes, but within those boundaries is an open playground to
have a great time with. That’s where I take my music.

Is my music worship music? No, not always. You probably won’t hear worship
music from me here. I do actually play a lot of worship music on my own, but
I just choose not to record or produce it. I want to provide people with fun,
cool, catchy, clean music. By not producing music which promotes cursing or
sexual thoughts or activities, I get to show listeners that there is a lot of
fun and enjoyment to be had in music outside of those things. Encouraging
people and showing them that there is a better way is a major part of God’s
plan, if you look through his Word.

So, yes, I am most definitely a Christian artist. Do I have a lot of worship
themes in my music? No, not really. But does that mean that a song doesn’t
honor God? I don’t think so. I think God smiles when he sees someone enjoying
His creation, whether that be music or something else.

If you read this far, thanks for reading. I’m writing this late at night so
I probably didn’t write as well as I could have, so do forgive me. Maybe I’ll
come back sometime and fix this up, but I just wanted to get this off my
chest for now.
