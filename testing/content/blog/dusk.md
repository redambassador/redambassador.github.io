Close your eyes, sit back, and feel the stillness sweep over you. Quiet synths
introduce you to a calm and peaceful realm where the world seems right and
clear. Then soft guitars take you airborne and show a view of the world from
overhead as the sun sets in the distance. This is Dusk.

I am very excited to share with you my new song which I’m calling “Dusk.” I
had shared a WIP with you all on Soundcloud for a while under the working
title of “Morning Coffee.” While listening to this song, I hope you can
picture yourself watching a sunset or waking up to a sunrise with a hot cup
of coffee (my personal preference) and can reflect for a moment. Also, check
out Psalm 46 verse 10 while you listen.

This song has been in the works for a while. Some life things have popped up
and prevented me from finishing it sooner. Nevertheless, I am very proud to
share this smooth, relaxing tune with you.

Enjoy, as always. :)
