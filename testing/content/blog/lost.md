This is a brand new song I wrote rather quickly. I haven’t written an original
song in a long while. I’ve been doing remixes and whatnot. I had a lot of fun
making this and got really passionate about it.

In this song, I kind of went back to my deeper, serious, and more thoughtful
side. It’s quieter. It’s got a nice, deep cello and some rich synths pulsating
through. I also recorded a little vocal line for the chorus that adds a little
more of a human element to it. I hope you enjoy this new Electronic / Chill /
Orchestral track!

>    This is a brand new original track from Red Ambassador. This song combines
> deep, rich elements of piano and cello with some hard-hitting electronic
> components that combine and form a passionate and beautiful sound.
>
>    I like to combine elements from different styles into one song. I don’t
> care for cliché sounds in a specific genre, so I aspire to create a new sound
> by taking bits and pieces from different styles and weaving them together. It
> makes for a nice challenge, as a producer, but also makes for a pleasant and
> interesting sound for the listener. I believe this song exemplifies my
> efforts in this area. I also added a vocal track to add more of a “human
> element” to the song. That was a little bit of a stretch for me, since I
> don’t have a great voice.
