Thank you for participating in this year’s competition. It’s exciting to see all these LMMS artists coming together.
This year, we made ACTUAL AWARDS for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place winners! Yes, they’re paper/pdf awards, but better than nothing, eh? Maybe you can print them off and put them on your wall or take a picture of you holding your award and post it to my Facebook page.</description></item><item><title>2013 LMMS Christmas Competition Winners</title><link>https://redambassadormusic.com/blog/2013-lmms-christmas-competition-results/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Dec 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://redambassadormusic.com/blog/2013-lmms-christmas-competition-results/</guid><description>Hey everybody!
