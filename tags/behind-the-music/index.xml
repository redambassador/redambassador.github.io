There is a meaning behind it, actually.
Before I called myself “Red Ambassador”, I went by the artist name “RED 7” (in all caps). That was just a name I had used as an internet name for a while. It was kind of something that stemmed from the fact that I liked the color red and I also liked WWII air force terminology.</description></item></channel></rss>
