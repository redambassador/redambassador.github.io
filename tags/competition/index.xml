      <description>So, I just wanted to give a shout out to a musical bro of mine. He just submitted his remix entry to the Citizen‚Äôs ‚ÄúMade Alive‚Äù remix contest. I was chatting with Spade and he was saying how excited he was to enter into this contest and I think that excitement really shows in the product that came out.
You gotta listen to his remix of Citizen‚Äôs song ‚ÄúMade Alive‚Äù! üòÄ</description>
